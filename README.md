# Undertale Demo lite
This is a decompile of Undertale's demo that's actually playable when loaded with GameMaker 8 lite(the gamemaker version where the demo was made).

Normally, if you load Undertale's demo on GameMaker 8 lite, you'll get a lot of errors and crashes. This version fixes
all of them, using lite-friendly alternatives. Of course, this doesn't mean there can't be bugs, so report any of them!

(Also, make sure that when reporting bugs you're actually using GameMaker 8 lite.)
